# Calibron 12
A Puzzle Invented by Theodore Edison (son of tommy)

## Goal
Fit all 12 rectangles into a perfect square.

Only one solution exists. (8 if you count the symmetries).


## Instructions
Mouse Click: advance one move.

Space: advance until the solution is found.

Press B:  backtrack - revert to last guess, and guess differently next time.

## Wow Very Fast!
### but shouldn't computers solve this in less than a second?

They can, but the code currently draws to the screen on every advancement.

if it's configuered to update the screen every 5000 advancements, the solution is reached incredibly fast.
